This repository contains the materials for D-Lab [WorkshopName] workshop. 

### Prerequisites
We recommend attending [Command Line Fundamentals](D-LabWorkshop1Link) prior to this workshop.

Check D-Lab's [Learning Pathways](https://dlab-berkeley.github.io/dlab-workshops/python_path.html) to figure out which of our workshops to take!

## Workshop Goals

This introductory workshop covers basics of Git using GitHub. This workshop is designed for people with no previous experience with Git or GitHub. We will cover key concepts and workflows, including version control, repository creation, branching, merging, and collaboration. You'll gain hands-on experience navigating GitHub, managing repositories, and contributing to projects, making it easier to streamline your work and collaborate with others. 


## Learning Objectives

After this workshop, you will be able to:
- Understand why we use version control and Git
- Learn basic terms used in Git, such as clone, commit, push, pull, and merge
- Learn how to clone repositories, make changes, and update changes on local and remote repositories
- Handle branches and resolve merge conflicts

## Installation Instructions

Before attending the workshop, please ensure you have gone through these
instructions.

You'll need to make sure `git` is installed on your system. General instructions
are available on [Github](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

* **Windows:** You can install `git` via [git for
  Windows](https://gitforwindows.org).
* **Mac:** It is very likely `git` should already come installed with your Mac.
  You can open a terminal and run `git version` to make sure. If it's not
  installed, you can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
* **Linux:** You can use whatever package management system your distribution
  uses to install `git`. For Debian/Ubuntu, this is `apt`. For Fedora, this will
  be `dnf`.

Once `git` is installed on your computer, open up the Markdown file
`lessons/01_getting_started.md` to create a Github account and set up
authentication tokens. Then, we'll download these materials using a `git clone`
step.
